# VGO_spatial_modelling
## Land Use Regression and Random Forest models developed for microbial emissions from livestock farms in the VGO study region. The aim of the study is to more accurately estimate exposure to livestock-related emissions. 

Background:
* Adverse health effects have been linked with exposure to livestock farms, likely due to airborne microbial agents.
* Accurate exposure assessment is crucial in epidemiological studies, however limited studies have modelled bioaerosols. 
* This study was conducted in a livestock dense region in the Netherlands and used measured concentrations of four different livestock-related emissions: two livestock commensals (Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus species (spp.)), and antimicrobial resistance genes (tetW and mecA).
* Land Use Regression (LUR) and Random Forest (RF) models were developed for each microbial agent using Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived livestock-related characteristics as predictors.
